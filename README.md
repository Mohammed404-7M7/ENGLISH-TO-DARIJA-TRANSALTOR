# English to Darija Translator 🇬🇧➡️🇲🇦

A simple yet clever web-based **English to Darija (Moroccan Arabic)** translator built with Flask.

## 🧠 How it Works

- Uses a large Created Manualy dataset  of English–Darija phrase pairs stored in `dataset.csv`.
- Translates full sentences or phrases using a combination of:
  - Phrase matching
  - Word-by-word translation
  - Text correction via `TextBlob`
- Learns over time — users can add new phrase pairs through the interface.

## 🖥️ Features

- Translate English sentences into Darija.
- Add your own phrases to the dataset.
- Intelligent matching for multi-word phrases.
- Auto-correction for better translation accuracy.
